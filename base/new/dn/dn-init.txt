	The file main.c in init/ needs to call the initialization routine
	of each kernel component. The routines name starts with the
	prefix and is followed by the word Initialization:
	#bugbug: For now we simply cant do that cause the initialization
	starts in another file. x64init.c for x86_64 and core/init.c.

	Ex: 
	kernelInit()  ?
	mmInit()  See: mm/mminit.c 
	fsInit()  See: fs/fs.c
	userInit()    ?
