Remember:
	The graphical routines depends on a 
	rich infra-structure to survive.
	A client/server ipc model runs all the communication
	between the application and the window server. If something fail
	in this communication, probably something is also fail
	in a graphical routine.


+ Syncronization.
	Read/write synchronization for socket files.
	The client/server ipc model will read and write sockets.
	All the graphical routines depends on this resource.

+ libc.
	It needs a lot of standard resources, 
	just like fcntl() and ioctl() support.
